# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2024 :christmas_tree:

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repo contains my Python solutions for this year's Advent of Code challenges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.12 or later installed.
* **Poetry**: This project uses Poetry for dependency management.

### Setup

Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:josh-spratt/advent-of-code-2024.git
cd advent-of-code-2024
```

Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install project dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Set the `AOC_COOKIE` Environment Variable

To access the Advent of Code input files programmatically, set an environment variable `AOC_COOKIE` with your session cookie:

```bash
export AOC_COOKIE=<your-session-cookie>  
```

* You can find your session cookie in your browser's storage when signed in to Advent of Code.
* Ensure you keep this value private and do not share or commit it to version control.

## Notes on Usage

### Respect Advent of Code Servers

* **Be responsible**: Only request input data for days that have been unlocked (available at midnight Eastern Time).
* Avoid sending unnecessary or excessive requests to the servers.

### Contributing

Feel free to fork this repo or open issues for suggestions.
